IMDB Review Site

A basic Node.js website for an extra credit assignment for CS 345 at UMass Amherst.  Incorporates the IMDB movie database with a web frontend to search, return and rent movies as a class project.  All code was put together by myself in a period of two days in a rush and shouldn't be judged therefore :)
